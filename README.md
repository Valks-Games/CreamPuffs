# CreamPuffs
I asked ChatGPT to generate a game about cats and dogs and it delivered.

Earlier I tried to ask it to generate scripts for Godot 4 but it would only generate from Godot 3. So a lot of the code it generated had to be corrected.

Anyways, cream puffs.

Massive image of a cream puff.

Here are the inputs to ChatGPT
```
Write a C# script in Godot. The player will die if they touch the outer 
bounds of the world. The bounds are 1000 in all directions from 0. Also 
if they go outside the bounds they will turn into a cat. The cat will 
say meow a bunch of times. Then lots of cream puffs will appear. 
```

```
But once they turn into a cat. They also turn into a dog. Its a crazy conspiracy. No one knows whats really going on!
```

```
after 10 seconds the cream puffs start chasing the player
```

```
Modify the player script to include simple movement script 
```
